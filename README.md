## Overview

Orphan instances suck. But there's no alternative. UNTIL TODAY.

`wide-open-world` takes the open world assumption and **super charges it**. You
want coherence? Fuck you, we've got more coherence than your program can handle.
Coherence with *every instance ever written.*

It's like Napster but for instances.

How does it work? When you need an instance, you just download it off the
internet at compile time and splice it in.
